=== In & Out Laundry - WordPress Theme Installation ===

1. Build the Theme Assets:
   -----------------------
   Open your terminal in the root project folder (where package.json is) and run:
   
   npm install
   npm run build

   This will compile the React app and place the files into `in-and-out-theme/dist`.

2. Create the Theme Zip:
   ---------------------
   Create a zip file of the folder `in-and-out-theme`. 
   
   Important: The zip file should contain the folder `in-and-out-theme`, and inside that folder should be `style.css`, `index.php`, `dist/`, etc.

3. Install in WordPress:
   ---------------------
   a. Go to your WordPress Dashboard.
   b. Go to **Appearance > Themes**.
   c. Click **Add New Theme**.
   d. Click **Upload Theme**.
   e. Upload your zip file.
   f. Click **Install Now** and then **Activate**.

4. Done!
   -----
   Your entire website will now look and function like the In & Out Laundry app.
   Note: Since this is a Single Page Application (SPA) theme, it takes over the frontend completely.
